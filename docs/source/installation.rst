Installation
============

The ``asr`` toolkit can be installed via pip:

.. code:: bash

    # pip install asr



Test installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can check if it worked by

.. code:: bash

    $ asr --version
    asr 0.1.1

Please send me an email (info@martin-thoma.de) if that didn't work.


Upgrading asr
--------------

Upgrading asr to the latest version is much easier:

.. code:: bash

    # pip install asr --upgrade
